About the project : 
This project is a simulation of a university database.
it has users and rooms.

users have names, id, age...etc
rooms have room numbers, access level

users can be : Admin, Student, Director, LabEmployee, Professor
rooms can be : ClassRoom, LectureHall, ConferenceRoom, Cabinet, DirectorCabinet

Example of using the program : 
first pick which user are you from the list 
then if you picked an admin you will have to enter a password otherwise you won't 
the program will display your information then will ask you what action do you want to do 
if you are an admin there is 3 actions 
1-access a room
2-grant access to a room for a user 
3-change the level access of user 
if you are not an admin there is only 1 action 
1-access a room 

if you try to access a room and your level isn't high enough for it the program will display : "you can't access this room"
other wise it'll display : "Access granted"

Note : I changed the name of the file containing the source codes for "PSSII_Homework2" to "PSS II - Homework 02 - Mosab Mohamed - B20-03" to match the naming criteria, I don't know if that will result in any problems with running the code or not
