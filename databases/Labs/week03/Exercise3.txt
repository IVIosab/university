This is the procedure for creating and selling a computer.
Let's start with the hardware: the computer must be either a laptop or a desktop, and its MAC or ID property can be used to identify it. It also has RAM and CPU capabilities.
The device's weight is a significant aspect in both circumstances.
If it is a laptop, it has the component options of memory only, different memories can be identified by its ID.
If it's a desktop, the component options include RAM, sound card, and video card, each with its own ID.
Now for the software side, the computers just need to install one operating system, which was originally software and has its own ID and version.
Furthermore, the computer can install several types of software that will support the computer's components.
After collecting all of the computer's components, it's ready to be sold, with each computer being offered with a variety of attachments, such as a keyboard, monitor, and mouse, each with its own set of capabilities.
